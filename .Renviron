# R on Windows cannot handle UTF-8 locale but MSYS does, and -- quite
# reasonably -- it sets everything to it. So we need to tell R to use
# the system locale when launched from MSYS (e.g. with make).
# Otherwise R attepts to use UTF-8 and fails ("During startup -
# Warning message: Setting LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 failed" warning, and
# failure, or wrong results if non-ASCII characters were used in
# scripts, or data). This requires a Windows environmental variable
# called `LC_WINDOWS_FIX` to be set to the desired locale (e.g.
# `Hungarian_Hungary.1250`). If it is not set, just use whatever was
# set (see `?Startup` for the format).
LC_CTYPE=${LC_WINDOWS_FIX-${LC_CTYPE}}
